This is the an android application that I have made. 

It lets you search for a book and will show you a list of books with their author name, book title, and the picture of the books icon.

It uses the OpenLibrary API: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api which searches for a book. returns the data as a json, and then I show it in a list. 

This application also has sharing capabilites, where it creates a sharing intent and allowing you to share the book you like in any social media you want.
